## Project Description
Did you know that the internet retail AKA E-Commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry? In 2019, it generated approximately $29 trillion dollars. E-Commerce Back end is an application that supports an E-Commerce website, where the user will be able to view products, categories, and their tags, along with updating them. You can also delete a whole list or the individual items.

Below is an example that shows the application's GET routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags:
